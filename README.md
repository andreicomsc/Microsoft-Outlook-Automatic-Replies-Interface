# Microsoft Outlook Automatic Replies Interface

Through this project, I developed a modernised prototype of the Microsoft Outlook Automatic Replies Interface using the Axure RP 11 tool. 

The redesign focuses on delivering a more intuitive and client-friendly UI/UX, while introducing extended functionality beyond the original implementation. 

Key features include the ability to set custom time periods, define regular weekly schedules, configure distinct settings for weekdays and weekends, and specify precise time ranges for automatic replies. 

This project enhanced my ability to apply user-centred design principles and prototyping tools to improve the usability and flexibility of existing software solutions.
